\section{Conclusion}
% gav det s√• mening at bruge LSTMs?

I have build small \gls{lstm} based model which achieved a precision of 
$67 \pm 3$ and a recall of $71 \pm 3$ from only raw data as input.
This shows that it is feasible to get a decent result from a 
\gls{lstm} based model without the use of feature extraction.
Although the result was not as impressive as TMSEG it still shows 
potential for \gls{lstm} based models. It does however show that
training time could become a problem if the model gets larger and more 
complex.
