\section{Evaluation}
% Sammenlign resultater mellem experimenterne og mellem andre modeller

\subsection{Results}
% the results with nice grafic representation
% sub-conclusion on each little test where we look at the results in TMSEG

\subsection{Discussion}
% What have we achieved? 
% Further work for it to be even better. 

\subsection{Learning what the Model has Learned}
% Can we learn something from what the model has learn. By somehow visualising the weight matrices we can
% se what the model has found to be importen and sometimes something interresting aboubt the problem can be learned

\subsection{Further Work}
